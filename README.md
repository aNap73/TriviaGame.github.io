Technical Trivia

#This is going to be my Technical Triva game.
It will be a basic quiz game, where I will
ask multiple choice questions in a timed format.

GL!
 
#Whats so cool about this one Ant?
  Question: function (Q, A, C){
    this.Question = Q;
    this.Answer = A;
    this.Choice = C;    
  },

  The code snipit above is my first attempt at creating a "constructor" in js.
  In other languages... this would be called a class! I use this "constructor" to
  generate all the questions in my project with the "new" keyword.

  While I am certainly not blazing any new trails here, it does represent my first
  use of "REAL" OOP in Javascript. Up until I taught myself this I was forced to use
  the = {} notation to declare objects individually one at a time... yech...

  SO MUCH BETTER...

  I can feel my oop powers aligning towards this language... it will all be over soon.

  MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahahHHAHAHAhahahaha ;)
